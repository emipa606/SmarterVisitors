Since visitors decide when they want to leave, it may not always happen at the best time.
This mod checks the map when visitor-groups decide to leave and can delay this from happening.

You can select what type of conditions should delay visitors from leaving in the mod-options:


-  Dangers on the map. These are things like raids, maddened animals, toxic fallout etc. If present visitors will ask you if they could stay for another day. You have the option to deny this to make them leave anyway, approve it to make them try again in 24 hours or just ask again in an hour.
-  Health-issues. If any pawn in the group are suffering from health-issues that require medical rest, they will check again in an hour until all pawns are healthy enough to travel.
-  UV-sensitivity (Biotech gene). If any pawn have the intense UV-sensitivity gene, the group will delay their travel until the sun has gone down.



The mod works well with the excellent mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552]Hospitality by Orion. The check for dangers on the map is adapted from the same check that hospitality-groups do when entering the map.

If you have any other ideas on what visitors or other groups should check when leaving, please leave a comment and Ill try to implement it!
